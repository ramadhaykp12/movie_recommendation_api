# Movie Recommender System

This project is a movie recommendation system developed as a learning exercise and for portfolio purposes. It showcases my ability to build a machine learning model using collaborative filtering techniques and deploy it using FastAPI.

## Key Features
- Collaborative filtering for personalized movie recommendations
- Built with FastAPI for fast and efficient API responses
- Automatically generated API documentation with Swagger UI

This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in data science, machine learning, and web development. I aim to enhance my understanding of these technologies and apply them in real-world scenarios.
